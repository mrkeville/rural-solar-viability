# rural-solar-viability

The README.md file (any additional Markdown or PDF files if needed) should provide enough information that someone else could
understand the purpose of the analysis and reproduce it from the underlying raw data. In particular, as a whole the documentation should: 
(1)  concisely explain the purpose of the analysis; 
(2) include instructions on how to obtain the original input data, such as where it can be downloaded or it should provide a script to
 download the data via an API; 
(3) explain what each script does and the order in which they should be run; 
(4) explain any additional files provided in the repository; and 
(5) discuss the results.

## Purpose of repository: Providing analysis of basic information to support decision makers involved in solar farm propagation in rural Upstate NY

The purpose of this repository is to make available high-level resources that provide information on key environmental factors impacted by solar farm installation, 
with the purpose of helping stakeholders make informed decisions about the best place to put solar farms in rural areas
